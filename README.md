BASIC NETWORK SNIFFER(CYBER SECURITY):
This repository hosts a basic Python network packet sniffer, 
packet_sniffer.py built with the Scapy library. It's designed to capture, dissect, and analyze real-time network traffic, providing insights into common protocols and packet structures. The project highlights hands-on experience with low-level network operations, protocol analysis (Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP), and problem-solving in a Windows environment.

This project directly relates to cybersecurity by:

1.)Enabling Threat Detection: It allows monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity and anomalies, aiding in early threat identification.

2.)Supporting Malware Analysis: By capturing payloads, it helps analyze malware communication and data exfiltration attempts.

3.)Facilitating Vulnerability Assessment: Observing unencrypted traffic can expose vulnerabilities like sensitive data transmission over insecure protocols.

4.)Assisting Incident Response: Captured traffic provides crucial forensic evidence to reconstruct security incidents and understand attack vectors.

5.)Deepening Protocol Understanding: Dissecting layers (Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP) is fundamental for building effective security controls like firewalls and IDS/IPS.

6.)Laying Groundwork for Security Tools: The experience forms a base for developing advanced cybersecurity tools.
